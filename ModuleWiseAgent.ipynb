      "Your festive-season performance was strong, with good gains in revenue, occupancy, and trip volumes.

Our dynamic pricing features helped improve demand capture and seat optimization, which contributed to this growth.\n",

      "Using the SVBT_PERFORMANCE document, we can see that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Trips and Seats Sold Increased**: November saw a significant increase in trips (508 → 754) and seats sold (16,594 → 25,473), indicating a positive trend.\n",
      "2. **Occupancy Improved**: Average occupancy improved from 82% to 86%, showing that the services are being utilized more efficiently.\n",
      "3. **Total GMV Increased**: Total GMV increased from ₹2.12 Cr to ₹2.65 Cr, indicating overall revenue growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are also some challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ASP Decline**: Average Selling Price (ASP) declined from ₹1,250 to ₹1,050, which may be a concern.\n",
      "2. **GMV per Trip Decline**: GMV per trip declined from ₹41,761 to ₹35,113, indicating that the revenue per trip is decreasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To identify growth opportunities, we can look at the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Route-Level Performance**: Some routes, such as Bangalore–Khammam, showed stable or marginally improved GMV per trip despite ASP reduction. Focusing on such routes could be a growth opportunity.\n",
      "2. **Service-Level Analysis**: Service-level analysis reveals heterogeneity in performance. Identifying services that are performing well and scaling them up could be a growth opportunity.\n",
      "3. **Day-of-Week (DOW) Behavior**: Weekends (Fri–Sat–Sun) contribute disproportionately to GMV. Optimizing pricing and inventory on weekends could be a growth opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PRICE_INTERVENTION_PRD document provides insights into the proactive price intervention system, which could be used to optimize pricing and maximize revenue.\n",

    "\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "1. OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "At an aggregate level, November showed:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Trips increased materially (508 → 754)\n",
    "• Seats sold increased significantly (16,594 → 25,473)\n",
    "• Average occupancy improved (82% → 86%)\n",
    "• Total GMV increased (₹2.12 Cr → ₹2.65 Cr)\n",
    "• ASP declined (₹1,250 → ₹1,050)\n",
    "• GMV per trip declined (₹41,761 → ₹35,113)\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates a volume-led growth pattern where higher trips\n",

    "\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "2. ROUTE-LEVEL PERFORMANCE PATTERNS\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "Across Bangalore-origin and return routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Several routes showed ASP decline but occupancy improvement\n",
    "• GMV per trip declined on many routes due to ASP compression\n",
    "• Select routes (e.g., Bangalore–Khammam) showed stable or\n",
    "  marginally improved GMV per trip despite ASP reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Routes with sharper GMV/Trip decline include:\n",
    "• Bangalore–Bapatla\n",
    "• Kandukuru–Bangalore\n",
    "• Tenali–Bangalore\n",
    "\n",

    "3. SERVICE-LEVEL DEEP DIVE INSIGHTS\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "Service-level analysis reveals heterogeneity:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Sleeper and Hybrid services behaved differently\n",
    "• Some services improved GMV via higher trip count\n",
    "• Others suffered GMV/Trip decline despite occupancy gains\n",
    "\n",
    "Example patterns observed:\n",
    "• ASP on redBus often declined alongside market ASP\n",
    "• In some services, market ASP dropped faster than SVBT ASP\n",
    "• In others, SVBT ASP corrected more aggressively than market\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "4. DAY-OF-WEEK (DOW) BEHAVIOR\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "DOW analysis shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Weekends (Fri–Sat–Sun) contribute disproportionately to GMV\n",
    "• Fridays and Saturdays often maintain higher ASP even when\n",
    "  weekday ASP declines\n",
    "• Occupancy spikes are more consistent on weekends\n",
    "• Some services show weekday ASP erosion with stable occupancy\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "5. ASP vs OCCUPANCY TRADE-OFF\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "Across multiple services:\n",
    "\n",
    "• ASP decline frequently coincides with occupancy gains\n",
    "• Services with >90% occupancy often operate at lower ASP\n",
    "• Some high-occupancy services still show GMV/Trip decline\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "6. MARKET COMPARISON SIGNALS\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "Where market data is available:\n",
    "\n",
    "• In some cases, SVBT ASP remained above market ASP\n",
    "• In others, market ASP declined more sharply than SVBT\n",
    "• Market occupancy often increased alongside SVBT occupancy\n",

    "--------------------------------\n",
    "7. WHAT IMPROVED vs WHAT DETERIORATED\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "Improved:\n",
